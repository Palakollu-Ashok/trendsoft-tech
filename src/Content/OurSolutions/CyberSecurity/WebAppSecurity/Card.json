Thatâ€™s barely surprising most of the companies built in-house unlike the operations systems, databases, and application software typically used on corporate networks- web applications from little to no time experience. This enables attackers to copy your information in the database through mistakes or omissions made in the course of developing and deploying applications."

We perform an analysis black box (perspective of an outside trespasser) and white box (analysis of the source code itself). If you are already a sufferer of a web attack detected oddity in your applications, we can offer incident response services to verify the problem in all possible cases providing detailed recommendations for fixing the issue by our experts."
